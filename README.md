# Dav3.co

This is the new version of my website, built using my static site generator [Weaving.](https://github.com/davemackintosh/weaving) Weaving is a new static site generator that allows you to simply focus on the content and layout of your website and not have to have a computer science degree to actually get started with.

This website; and any Weaving website, is built using Liquid templates and markdown. To develop with this site, you need only have weaving installed and run `weaving serve` in the website directory.
