As a seasoned software engineering manager with 20+ years of experience, I specialise in creating and leading high-impact engineering teams, driving technical innovation, and ensuring seamless communication between stakeholders. I also have a wealth of experience in designing system architectures and managing platforms.

I excel at demystifying complex technical challenges for non-technical teams, fostering a collaborative environment where ideas can flow freely and quickly translate into results.

From leading cross-functional teams in global projects to designing scalable architectures, I ensure that both technical excellence and stakeholder needs align and by building inclusive teams and streamlining communication, Iâ€™ve consistently delivered high-quality software, reducing delivery timelines and improved team performance.

I spend most of my time leading and mentoring teams of developers writing Rust, Go and React/TypeScript in serverless environments.
